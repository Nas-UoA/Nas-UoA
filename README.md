## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a financial analyst and a FinTech Specialist, with more than 15 year of experience in the banking and financial sector. As a two times honored MSc student, I became a PhD student with  the interest of researching the machine learning applications in finance. I am an eager learner, ready to explore the new paths that innovating technologies offer.
